This repository contains notes, code, and data for our Humanities Data in R
workshop, held virtually on 29 July from 9h-12h Central. A Zoom invitation for
the live workshop will be sent out as a seperate email. Feel free to use/share/adopt
these notes for other courses.

## Code of Conduct

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
make our event a better place.

In order for this tutorial to be successful, we ask that participants take note
of the following guidelines throughout the session:

- This is an interactive workshop, and we expect everyone to, as best as possible,
follow along with the tutorial.
- At the same time, please stay at the same point with us in the tutorial. If you are
finished with a section ahead of time, you are more than welcome to hack away at our
code. We find that staying together through the tutorial works best for everyone
involved.

## Setup

In order to minimize setup issues during the remote workshop, we will be using 
a hosted version of the R programming language called [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud).
This service runs R in the browser and requires no local setup. All that is needed 
is to create a free account using the instructions below. The service can be used
for 15 hours per month for free, after which additional computing time can be
purchased accorinding to several different plans. Alternatively, the 100% free and
open-source desktop version of R and RStudio may be used. It provides the exact same
functionality, but must be installed locally. Instructions for installing this version
are also provided below. We are happy to offer support for the Desktop installation process 
asychronously before and after the workshop, but may not be able to directly help with
local issues during the workshop.

### RStudio RCloud (recommended for the workshop itself)

In order to setup RStudio RCloud, click on the link below to open a new window. You 
will be prompted to create an account.

- [Course Invitation]()

Once you are setup, you should see a screen similar to the image below.

And that's it. Just be ready to log back into RStudio with your email and password on
the day of the workshop.

### RStudio Desktop (recommended for future work)

In order to install the course materials locally on your computer, you will need to
install three components. Links for this are given below; if you are not familiar with
installing programming components on your local machine, we suggest waiting until 
after the workshop to follow these steps.

## Schedule

This workshop will focus on giving an overview of how R can be used to perform a variety
of visualization tasks relevant in the Humanities. Due to the short duration of the workshop,
we will focus on the application of using R for network analysis. Materials for extending this
to other application domains (for example, working with text, images, and spatial data) are
linked to below. With this in mind, the workshop will (tentatively) be organized as follows:

- **(09:00-09:10)** Introductions and Setup
- **(09:10-10:00)** Data Visualization in R
- **(10:00-10:10)** *break*
- **(10:10-11:00)** Network Analysis in R
- **(11:00-11:10)** *break*
- **(11:10-12:00)** Data Creation and Discussion

In this first two sessions, participants will work with pre-constructed datasets. The final 
sesion will focus on how to organize and load data created by the participants.
